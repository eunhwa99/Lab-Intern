## Lab intern projects
- Develop motion recognition Android application for writing a thesis paper

### Phase 1: Exploring Smartphone Sensors
#### AllSensorForAndroid
- Android application that searches and tests all sensors that exist in Samsung Galaxy smartphones.

In the first phase, I developed an application to investigate the types of sensors available in smartphones and conducted hands-on experiments to understand their unique characteristics. 
Through this process, I gained valuable insights into how to work with smartphone sensors and mastered the techniques for developing sensor-based applications on the Android platform

### Phase 2: Use different methods for upgrading motion recognition
#### SensorDetection
- Android application that tests and collects data for accelerometer and gyroscope sensor for motion detection. It also includes complementary filter to upgrade accuracy of sensor data.
- FFT python code to process sensor data by removing redundant
- [Project progress & results](https://github.com/eunhwa99/Lab-Intern/tree/master/SensorDetection/Documents)

### Pase 3: Write thesis paper
#### MotionRecognition
 - Android application we used to write a thesis paper.
 - This application includes all background knowledge we learned by searching other thesis papers and developing andorid applications (AllSensorForAndroid, SensorDetection)

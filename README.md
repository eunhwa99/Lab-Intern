## Lab intern projects

### AllSensorForAndroid
- Android application that searches and tests all sensors that exist in Samsung Galaxy smartphones

### SensorDetection
- Android application that tests and collects data for accelerometer and gyroscope sensor for motion detection. It also includes complementary filter to upgrade accuracy of sensor data.
- FFT python code to process sensor data by removing redundant
- [Project progress & results](https://github.com/eunhwa99/Lab-Intern/tree/master/SensorDetection/Documents)
 ### MotionRecognition
 - Android application we used to write a thesis paper.
 - This application includes all background knowledge we learned by searching other thesis papers and developing andorid applications (AllSensorForAndroid, SensorDetection)

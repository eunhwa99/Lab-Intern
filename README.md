# Lab intern projects
## Motion Recognition Android Application Development
Developed an Android-based motion recognition application as part of a lab internship to support the completion of a thesis paper.

This project was executed in three distinct phases:

### Phase 1: Exploring Smartphone Sensors
#### [AllSensorForAndroid](https://github.com/eunhwa99/Lab-Intern/tree/master/AllSensorforAndroid)
- Designed and implemented an Android application to identify and test all sensors available in Samsung Galaxy smartphones.
- Conducted hands-on experiments to understand the unique characteristics and functionalities of each sensor.
- Acquired in-depth knowledge of sensor APIs and techniques for developing sensor-integrated Android applications.
- [Project Deliverable](https://github.com/eunhwa99/Lab-Intern/blob/master/AllSensorforAndroid/Documents/AllSensorForAndroid.pdf)

### Phase 2: Investigate specific sensors
#### [SensorDetection](https://github.com/eunhwa99/Lab-Intern/tree/master/SensorDetection)
- Developed an Android application to collect data from the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors for motion detection.
- Implemented a complementary filter to enhance the accuracy of sensor data.
- Processed collected sensor data using FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) in Python to remove noise and redundant information.

### Pase 3: Write thesis paper
#### [MotionRecognition](https://github.com/eunhwa99/Lab-Intern/tree/master/MotionRecognition)
- Created a comprehensive Android application that consolidated knowledge and tools developed in earlier phases (AllSensorForAndroid and SensorDetection).
- The application facilitated the analysis required for the thesis and included research insights from academic papers.
- Published a thesis paper utilizing the results derived from this application.
